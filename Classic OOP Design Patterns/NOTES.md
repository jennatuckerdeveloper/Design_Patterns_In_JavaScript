I think that one of the core concepts in OOP in Java is coding abstract methods and classes.
I think that Luke did something like this... I bet I could recreate that still.
So you create an abstract class with an abstract method.
Then you extend a class with that parent and override those methods.
I think probably when Allen Holub was making his class in 2015, Java had abstract classes and abstract methods.
But I think Java seems not to have had the syntax of @Override.
No, that does not seem correct. It seems older.
It is optional... but it seems like he would use it. It catches a lot of errors.
A good example is when you change the params passed to the parent class method.
You might get both versions with the difference of the params on the child.

How does abstract class / abstract method concept different from an interface?
I think the difference is that you actually want to define some things on the abstract class.
It's a partial class, if that makes sense.  
An interface I don't think would have some methods or values defined for all classes that implement it.

Is super / sub class the same as parent / child class?
Yes, I think so.
So in JavaScript, you call the super.
I think that is the constructor of the parent.
