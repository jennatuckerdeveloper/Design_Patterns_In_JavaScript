Articulating My Deeper Goal As A Software Engineer:

I came into software engineering from an entirely separate career focused in the humanities, education, and nonprofits work. Having spent my entire adult life in those areas of focus, I had a mastery of rich concepts and theories. I had also developed sophisticated learning practices and mastered a modern and innovative approach to learning. I favored a highly interdisciplinary focus. That made me confident I could learn an entirely new field in the sciences.

For as long as I work in tech, I want to find out how close I can come to knowing this field with the depth and precision I had evolved in my prior field. So as long as I am focusing on software engineering, I want to keep identifying pivotal growth areas and seeking innovative learning materials to rapidly transform my understanding and skills as an engineer.

The intention of Design Patterns seems to be capturing accumulated software engineering knowledge into learnable, repeatable patterns. A real understand of these patterns would go beyond an ability to recite these concepts or reproduce existing code samples for something like interviews. Richer goals would be to comprehend the architecture of a code base, understand the overarching goals of the abstractions, and quickly make and communicate well between engineers decisions about how to design software.

This Project Idea:

Take an active approach to bringing together two excellent Design Patterns learning resources, Mosh Hamedani's Ultimate Design Patterns Course and Allen Holub's Design Patterns In The Real world, to gain a deeper, more intuitive understanding of classic OOP design patterns.

My Meta Question Going In:

Both of these courses are taught in Java, a classic OOP language. I am a JavaScript / Node developer. JavaScript is a prototypical language that includes a syntax to leverage OOP programming concepts, and TypeScript allows strong typing and missing ideas like programming to interfaces.

Can I quickly gain a better mastery of these design patterns through translating these concepts presented in Java into JavaScript and/or Typescript?

How do I translate these into JavaScript? Does TypeScript make this easier at times?

To what extent does class syntax and TypeScript belie the ways JavaScript truly runs differently under the hood from an OOP language such as Java?

Is it more useful to study functional programming patterns like closures and currying when programming in JavaScript or Typescript using React, especially now that hooks have been added to function components?

Which of these design patterns have recognizable, close correlations in functional programming?

Which of these design patterns gets used in or has a close relationship to the React framework?
